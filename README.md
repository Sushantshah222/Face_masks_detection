<h3>Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.</h3>


I have started with a variety of datasets to train a binary convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras/TensorFlow.

This contains the Kaggle Face Mask Detection Photographs dataset, which comprises images of correctly and poorly worn masks, as well as supplementary datasets comprising images of correctly worn masks.

To recognize faces in a picture or real-time video, I utilized the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm to reduce real-life photos down to the face area for efficient identification. I've set the region of interest to a certain frame.

After that, the binary CNN model was used to forecast each facial region. The predictions are drawn exactly next to the face area's rectangle, showing whether each identified human has a masked, unmasked, or no face.

For free access to GPUs and to start with a smaller dataset, I utilized Google Colaboratory ('Colab' for short).

## Feature <br>
This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.<br> <br>
