# Face Mask Detection using Deeplearning

With the help of Deeplearning & Computer Vision, I have created Facemask detector.

I have started with a variety of datasets to train a binary convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras/TensorFlow.

This contains the Kaggle Face Mask Detection Photographs dataset, which comprises images of correctly and poorly worn masks, as well as supplementary datasets comprising images of correctly worn masks.

To recognize faces in a picture or real-time video, I utilized the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm to reduce real-life photos down to the face area for efficient identification. I've set the region of interest to a certain frame.

After that, the binary CNN model was used to forecast each facial region. The predictions are drawn exactly next to the face area's rectangle, showing whether each identified human has a masked, unmasked, or no face.

For free access to GPUs and to start with a smaller dataset, I utilized Google Colaboratory ('Colab' for short).
